Labyrinth-Demo
==============
This is a HTML5/Javascript project that demonstrates device orientation events. Note that the project was programmed such that it only works on a mobile device (e.g. phones, tablets). 

### Usage
After loading the demo, it will ask you to rotate your device to landscape mode. After rotating, tap the screen to begin, and you can begin tilting your device to move a "marble" around on the screen. Rotating back to portrait mode will "pause" the demo.

Each time you resume the demo from a paused state, it will recalibrate the center position based on how the device is held.
